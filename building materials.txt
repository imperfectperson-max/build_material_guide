1. Introduction
The construction industry in South Africa faces significant challenges due to volatile building material prices. 
According to Statistics South Africa, the construction material price index rose by 6.5% year-on-year in 2024, following annual growth of 6.6% in 2023, placing substantial pressure on contractors and developers. Small contractors and independent developers particularly lack access to structured pricing intelligence, forcing them to manually compare suppliers and make purchasing decisions without predictive insight.
This project proposes the development of a Building Materials Price Intelligence Platform—a secure, full-stack system integrating web and mobile applications with machine learning capabilities. The system aims to demonstrate how predictive analytics can provide actionable insights into material price movements while maintaining secure and scalable software architecture, addressing a critical gap in the South African construction market.
2. Background and Motivation
2.1 Problem Context
Building material prices in South Africa fluctuate due to multiple factors including supply chain instability, import/export dependencies, inflationary pressures, seasonal demand changes, and regional supplier differences. The Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) identified steel, cement, sand, copper, timber, PVC, bitumen, and masonry blocks as particularly volatile materials in the South African market. These price fluctuations pose significant challenges for construction project management, often resulting in cost overruns and project delays.
2.2 Current Limitations
The current state of building materials procurement in South Africa presents several critical challenges:
• Contractors rely on manual price comparison across suppliers
• No centralized, structured dataset of historical pricing exists
• Absence of predictive intelligence for short-term price changes
• Purchasing decisions are reactive rather than data-driven
• Limited tools available for anomaly detection in pricing
2.3 Research Foundation
Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for construction material price forecasting. Studies indicate that data-driven techniques, particularly machine learning models, have emerged as crucial tools for construction materials price forecasting over the past two decades. Traditional econometric methods have been challenged by their inability to capture frequent fluctuations in construction material prices, creating an opportunity for more sophisticated predictive approaches.
A 2025 study demonstrated that LSTM models achieved RMSE values as low as 1.390 with MAPE values of 0.957, representing improvements of up to 59% over traditional ARIMA models for construction material price forecasting. Similarly, research has shown that gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost can effectively handle the non-linearity of time series data with efficient self-learning abilities, performing exceptionally well in forecasting tasks.
3. Research Objectives
3.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate whether machine learning models can accurately forecast short-term (7–30 day) building material price movements using publicly available supplier data from the South African market, thereby providing contractors with actionable pricing intelligence.
3.2 Secondary Objectives
• Design and implement a secure backend system for price data ingestion and processing
• Develop a web application for analytics, supplier comparison, and price trend visualization
• Develop a mobile application for real-time field access to pricing information
• Implement robust authentication and API security mechanisms
• Compare supervised machine learning models against traditional statistical baselines
• Create a structured dataset of building material price history for the South African market
4. Research Question
Can supervised machine learning models outperform traditional statistical forecasting methods in predicting short-term building material price fluctuations in the South African construction market?
5. Literature Review
5.1 Machine Learning in Construction Price Forecasting
The application of machine learning to construction material price forecasting has gained significant traction in recent years. A comprehensive systematic literature review analyzing publications from 2012 to 2022 identified that Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were the most frequently employed forecasting models. The review noted a significant increase in research activity since 2016, indicating growing interest in applying advanced analytical techniques to construction economics.
Research demonstrates that forecasting models can be broadly classified into causal modeling and time-series analysis categories. Causal models analyze historical data alongside independent variables such as Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to forecast construction material prices. Time-series models, conversely, rely primarily on historical price patterns to predict future values.
5.2 Comparative Model Performance
Recent comparative studies have provided valuable insights into relative model performance. A 2025 framework for construction material price forecasting demonstrated that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all model types. The study found that LSTM models consistently achieved the highest accuracy, with improvements of up to 59% over traditional ARIMA models.
Research comparing XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM for time series forecasting revealed that each model has distinct advantages. XGBoost performs well at finding complex relationships between variables and includes regularization features that help avoid overfitting. Random Forest, as an ensemble method combining multiple decision trees, provides robust predictions across varied datasets. LSTM networks excel at capturing time-related patterns through their sophisticated gating mechanism, making them particularly effective for sequential data with long-term dependencies.
A comparative analysis examining machine learning methods for forecasting in different contexts found that Random Forest with differentiated inputs proved to be the best performing method across scenarios with varying complexity, including situations with jumps, random walks, or combinations of both. The study noted that while XGBoost was competitive, machine learning algorithms generally delivered consistently better results than traditional time series methods when additional complexities were present.
5.3 Data Acquisition and Web Scraping
Web scraping has emerged as a critical technique for real-time market intelligence in the construction industry. Research indicates that construction companies can transform into agile entities by monitoring suppliers' websites and tracking material availability and pricing fluctuations. This approach enables proactive procurement strategies rather than reactive responses to market changes.
Studies show that 45% of construction companies currently use basic analytics, while another 45% are transitioning to more advanced digital tools, highlighting growing recognition of data's role in cost management. Web scraping provides advantages including smarter procurement through supplier pricing trend analysis, efficient resource use through monitoring utilization patterns, and improved market timing for material purchases based on price fluctuations.
5.4 South African Construction Market Context
The South African construction industry faces unique challenges that make pricing intelligence particularly valuable. Market analysis indicates that the construction material price index for civil engineering rose by 7% year-on-year in early 2024, following annual growth of 4.4% in 2023. The volatility is driven by factors including exchange rate movements affecting import parity prices, seasonal variations in construction activity, and supply shocks such as mill outages or transport disruptions.
Research examining trends in building material prices in South Africa identified that volatile materials include steel, cement, sand, copper, timber, PVC, bitumen, and masonry blocks. The study emphasized that understanding key factors contributing to price trends is essential for finding solutions to problems of project abandonment and gaps between demand and supply of basic infrastructure.
6. System Architecture
The proposed system consists of five major interconnected components, designed to provide end-to-end functionality from data collection to user interface delivery.
6.1 Data Acquisition Layer
The data acquisition layer will employ web scraping techniques to collect pricing information from South African building material suppliers. Modern web scraping tools, costing as little as $0.005 per page scrape, offer automated extraction capabilities with features including scheduled data collection, handling of dynamic content, and standardized data formatting. The system will implement:
• Automated web scraping of supplier catalogues and online price lists
• PDF price list extraction using optical character recognition where necessary
• Scheduled data collection to maintain currency of pricing information
• Data validation and cleaning pipeline to ensure data quality
• Storage of attributes including material name, supplier, region, price, date, and bulk pricing information
6.2 Backend Architecture
The backend will be built using industry-standard technologies including PostgreSQL for data storage, RESTful API endpoints, JWT-based authentication, feature engineering pipelines, model inference services, and caching layers for performance optimization.
6.3 Machine Learning Component
The machine learning component will implement baseline models (naïve forecast, moving average, ARIMA) and advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Prophet, LSTM) with evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics.
6.4 Web and Mobile Applications
The web dashboard will provide supplier comparison, historical trends, forecasts, and anomaly alerts. The mobile application will offer quick searches, geolocation-based supplier comparison, and push notifications for price changes.
7. Security Architecture
Security will be implemented through JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, bcrypt/Argon2 password hashing, HTTPS encryption, rate limiting, input validation, and protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.

Week 1-2: Data collection, web scraping implementation, data cleaning, EDA
Week 2-4: Backend development, database design, API implementation, security
Week 3-5: ML model development, feature engineering, training, evaluation
Week 4-6: Frontend development for web and mobile applications
Week 6-7: Integration, testing, deployment, documentation
9. Team Structure
Member 1: Backend Developer & Security Lead
Member 2: Machine Learning Engineer
Member 3: Frontend Web Developer
Member 4: Mobile Developer & Data Collection Lead
10. Expected Contributions
This project will contribute a structured dataset of South African building material prices, comparative ML model evaluation for price forecasting, secure full-stack implementation, and a deployable system demonstrating practical AI application in construction economics.
11. Limitations
Limitations include dependence on publicly available supplier data, limited historical depth initially, potential reduction in model predictability during market shocks, 7-week timeline constraints, and reliance on free-tier cloud infrastructure.
12. Future Work
Future enhancements include integration with wholesale supplier APIs, reinforcement learning for purchase timing, SMS/WhatsApp alerts, expansion to additional African markets, project management system integration, and advanced anomaly detection.
13. Conclusion
This project proposes a comprehensive Building Materials Price Intelligence Platform addressing a critical gap in the South African construction market. The 7-week timeline with 4 team members is feasible given the clear division of responsibilities. Research demonstrates that machine learning approaches can achieve up to 59% improvement in prediction accuracy over traditional methods. The system represents an opportunity to demonstrate how modern software engineering and machine learning can effectively solve real-world problems in construction economics.
